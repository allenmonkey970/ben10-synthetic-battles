This project builds on the [Ben 10 Alien Universe Realistic Battle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/ben-10-alien-universe-realistic-battle-dataset?select=ben10_aliens.csv) and adds a synthetic, 
expanded dataset for testing and analysis. The goal is to experiment with machine learning models, data pipelines, and statistical methods using a fun dataset.

## Contents

- **Original Data:** Sourced from Kaggle, including alien stats, enemy relationships, and battle records.
- **Synthetic Data:** Additional battles and character variations were generated for testing.
- **Scripts:** Tools for merging, cleaning, and augmenting the datasets.
